# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Module 17 Challenge

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to compare paid Vine reviews with unpaid reviews, particularly focussing on the five-star reviews. This is in order to determine if there is any bias visible in the paid Vine reviews.

## Results:
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

- There were 5,012 paid reviews and 109,297 unpaid reviews in total

- 40.5% of the paid reviews were five-star. 45.7% of the unpaid reviews were five-star

## Summary:
In summary, there appears to be no positivity bias for reviews in the paid Vine program. In fact it seems Vine reviews tend to be slightly harsher than the unpaid reviews. One additional analysis that we could do with the dataset is to compare percentages of one-star ratings. This may help determine if the Vine reviews are more harsh overall, or just less extreme (tending towards the middle with a more nuanced review).
